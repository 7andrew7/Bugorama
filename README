This repository is an attempt at a "bug benchmark" for evaluating
various static and dynamic analysis tools.  The tests include outright
bugs (e.g., use-after-free), undefined behaviors (e.g., signed integer
wraparound), and dubious programming practices (e.g., implicit switch
fall-through).

See the Results document for a summary of results with various tools.
